# The-first-AI-project-to-study
This is my first deep learning program. It uses the CIFAR10 dataset and can identify the categories of pictures.

The Jupyter file can be directly used in Colab or Kaggle.

Note:

- It is recommended to use a GPU. The training time on a T4 graphics card is about 1 minute.
- If using a CPU, the training time may reach 5 - 10 minutes.
- The data has been trained for 10 epochs. You can increase or decrease the number of training epochs according to the performance of your device or your requirements.
- I provided a test example image, which is an X-wing fighter.
- If you have a GPU, use test_gpu.py for testing. If you don't have a GPU, use test.py for testing.
